# Pizza Tower Decompilation
Pain is all but guaranteed

# Dependencies
- The `.bank` files from the game. They hold all sounds and music for usage with FMOD.
Simply copy the `sounds` folder from the game into the `datafiles` folder in the project, no strings attached.

- The [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk.zip).
Download it somewhere in your computer and change the Steamworks extension's config to match the path. Pizza Tower's Steam App ID is `2231450`, but it's not really necessary to change. It'll default to Spacewar.

- GameMaker `v2022.11.1.56` - [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2022.11.1.56.exe) / [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2022.11.1.56.pkg) - With runtime `v2022.11.1.75`.
Pretty sure v1.0 of the game was built on this version, and it works.
Any previous versions aren't recommended, but later versions should be fine for now.
