# Pizza Tower Decompilation
Pain is all but guaranteed

# Dependencies
- The `.bank` files from the game. They hold all sounds and music for usage with FMOD.
Simply copy the `sounds` folder from the game into the `datafiles` folder in the project, no strings attached.
- The [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk.zip).
Download it somewhere in your computer and change the Steamworks extension's config to match the path.
